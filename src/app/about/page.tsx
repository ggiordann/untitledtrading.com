                  <p className="leading-[150%]">We're four 16-year-old founders redefining quantitative trading through autonomous AI agents. While traditional firms like Citadel and Renaissance rely on thousands of employees, we've built a system that operates 24/7 with just servers and code.
                  </p>
                  <p className="leading-[150%]">Our journey began at a Jane Street recruiting event. Standing on our toes to blend in with university students, we discovered how mathematics and AI could transform finance. That night, we decided: why work for a quant firm when we could build a better one?
                  </p>
                  <p className="leading-[150%]">In just months, we've developed a fully autonomous trading pipeline using LLM-based agents coordinated through our proprietary Model Context Protocol. Our system connects to 20+ real-time APIs, processes everything from satellite data to news sentiment, and executes trades in milliseconds.
                  </p>
                  <p className="leading-[150%]">Our backtesting results speak for themselves: 2.74 Sharpe ratio, 214% annualized returns, outperforming industry giants with a fraction of their resources. We're not just building another trading algorithm; we're creating the first truly AI-native hedge fund.
                  </p>
                  <p className="leading-[150%]">Currently raising $398K AUD to transition from paper trading to live markets, with plans to obtain an Australian Financial Services License and scale globally. Our vision: prove that autonomous agents can consistently outperform traditional institutions.
